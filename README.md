# OpenCV-and-ROS-Color-Detection
Created a program that used OpenCV and ROS software/packages to implement color blob detection. This program was implemented using a video of three cups (red, blue, and green) moving against a mostly stagnant background. OpenCV was mainly used for the color blob detection part, while ROS was mainly used to implement the program onto the video.
